# ball-launcher

## What is it?

Material used in teaching highschool physics alongside computer science and Python (and some cool libraries).

### For now:

Simulating and graphically representing a parabolic motion of an object using python (turtle), some highschool Physics and other cool programming topics.

### What's next?

Ideally, it could grow into a larger set multidisciplinary projects (at least on Natural Sciences and Computer Science!), to teach students from different ages and help them engage in STEAM projects.

## How to run it

Just tell python to run the file "launcher.py" on youn environment.
