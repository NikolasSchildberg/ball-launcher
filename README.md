## For now
Simulating and graphically representing a parabolic motion of an object using python (turtle), some highschool Physics and other cool programming topics.

## What's next?
Ideally, it could grow into a larger set multidisciplinary projects (at least on Natural Sciences and Computer Science!), to teach students from different ages and help them engage in STEAM projects.
